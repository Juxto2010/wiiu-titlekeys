# wiiu-titlekeys

this is a permanent github pages site for the latest wiiu titlekeys (obtained from vault.titlekeys.ovh) extracted and published to the web.

This site (SHOULD) never go down, as its a github repository I will NEVER abandon or delete, and I will (try to) always update to the latest titlekey's site whenever I have the chance.

I only made this as a personal use, as many titlekey sites failed for me, but anyone can use this, AND because really other sites seem to get shut down often, or atleast stop working.

Just load titlekeys site ( https://skylerspark.github.io/wiiu-titlekeys/ ) Into WiiU UsbHelper, and it will work fine.

## Also if you load the site and want to get the titlekey of a specific game, Please wait about 1 minute or atleast until the "Region [ Any ]" and "Type [ Any ]" boxes appear near the top. This site uses a very finicky filtering system that has trouble loading quickly, so give it a bit of time.
